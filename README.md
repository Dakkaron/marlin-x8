Marlin 1.1.5 with TronXY X8 configuration 

This is Marlin 1.1.5 vanilla firmware with custom configuration to make it work for TronXY X8.
I kept the original setting of the tronxy x8, with the only difference that the language is set to italian.
Customize Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h for your setup.

Note:
Configured to make it work with CXY-V.2 board(thanks to siliconzoo).
I just made the LCD display work.
